# S1 Twitter Crawler Go

The name says everything: it's from [SumOne](http://www.github.com/sumoners),
it's a twitter crawler and it's written in Go!

## Installation

Simply insert your twitter access information into the `config.json` file, then
`go build .`.

Run the binary with the keywords you want to track such as:

`./s1-twitter-crawler-go cheese steak wine`

Then, point your browser to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to
get realtime results in your browser.

## Why?

I'm learning how "to go", and this is a nice way to see concurrency, web, api
connections and other stuff work.

I've open sourced this to allow you to learn go as i'm doing :)
